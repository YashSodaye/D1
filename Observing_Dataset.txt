    - Similarly, the EST department had a massive increase in 2014 with a value of 39114.92273, which is an outlier compared to other years.

3. **Consistent Values**:
    - Some departments like HND (Handicrafts) and POL (Polymers) show relatively consistent values over the years, indicating stable performance or budget allocation.

4. **Outliers and Spikes**:
    - The data for EST in 2014 shows a spike with a value of 39114.92273, which is an outlier when compared to other years.
    - Another noticeable spike is seen in the CER department in 2010 with a value of 5000.
